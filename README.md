Hi!👋 I am a Data Analyst and Digital Strategist with extensive experience managing local and international projects and teams since 2012. Currently, I am in charge of the Data Analysis project at TBWA Spain, contributing data-driven insights to improve strategy and creativity for PlayStation 🎮, McDonald's 🍔🍟 and Estee Lauder Companies 💄💅🏻.
