Hi there!ðŸ‘‹ I am a Data Analyst and Digital Strategist with extensive experience managing local and international projects and teams since 2012. Currently, I am in charge of the Data Analysis project at TBWA Spain, contributing data-driven insights to improve strategy and creativity for PlayStation, McDonald's and Estee Lauder Companies.
